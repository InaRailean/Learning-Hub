Because clustering is used in a broad array of industries, becoming proficient in this process will help you expand your skillset in a widely applicable way.\n\nIn this activity, you are a consultant for a scientific organization that works to support and sustain penguin colonies. You are tasked with helping other staff members learn more about penguins in order to achieve this mission.\n\nThe data for this activity is in a spreadsheet that includes datapoints across a sample size of 345 penguins, such as species, island, and sex. Your will use a K-means clustering model to group this data and identify patterns that provide important insights about penguins.\n\n**Note**: Because this lab uses a real dataset, this notebook will first require basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.\n\n\n### 1.2 Step 1: Imports\n\nImport statements including K-means, silhouette_score, and StandardScaler.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import standard operational packages.\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n# Important tools for modeling and evaluation.\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n# Import visualization packages.\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-19T11:20:37.139328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-19T11:20:37.139972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-19T11:20:40.817335Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-19T11:20:37.139934Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-19T11:20:40.816213Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Pandas is used to load the penguins dataset, which is built into the seaborn library.

Consider the process\nyou used, key tools, and the results of your investigation.**\n\nAnalysis results for both inertia and silhouette score show that the optimal number of clusters is 6. There are 3 species and there are main differences between male and female individuals of the same specie. The result of 6 clusters reffers to 3 species and 2 sexes for each specie, therefore there are 6 clusters. 2 species: Adelie and Chinstrap have some mixed data in clusters 2 and 4. Other species are accurately identified by the model.\n\n**What summary would you provide to stakeholders?**\nThe model has a high accuracy as it identified 6 clusters as the optimal number. That refers to 3 species and 2 sexes for each specie.\n\n#### 1.6.1 References\n\nGorman, Kristen B., et al. “Ecological Sexual Dimorphism and Environmental Variability within a Community of Antarctic Penguins (Genus Pygoscelis).” PLOS ONE, vol. 9, no. 3, Mar. 2014, p. e90081.
